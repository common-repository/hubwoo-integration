== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Go to the HubSpot WooCommerce Settings page and Enable the integration. 
2. Enable the logging of each API request. 
3. Save the settings.

We provide updates every 5 minutes. However, HubSpot takes some time to reflect on the properties. There are a few points you can crosscheck:

- Please update the integration with the latest version.
- Check API logs.
- Please contact us, if still facing issues.

=  I just installed your plugin and am wondering if there is sync of HubSpot contact details to the WooCommerce user database since this is the missing link I search for most. Is there anything else that I need to set up to get this working? =

There is no extra setup needed as the updated information is synced with Hubspot within 5 minutes. 

The plugin only updates the field data that are created. If you feel some extra fields or other data is needed, please feel free to contact us.
